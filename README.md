<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The project was designed so to test the students capabilities of hooking up API routes and ensuring that they could manage the back end SQL connection without errors. This project ensured we were able to set up error handling with bad requests and that we could comfortably meet the requirements setout by the SPEC.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The ORM should be used to manage the requests of an online store when organising their backend stock. Stock can be organised in a variety of different ways, and indexed through either Category id, Product id or Tag id. Each item is stored on a SQL data model and can be retired through the API routes.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://sydney.bootcampcontent.com/university-of-sydney/usyd-syd-fsf-pt-08-2021-u-c/-/blob/master/Unit-13-ORM/02-Homework/README.md)_
